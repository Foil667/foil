# NEURAL_MESH — Goals & Next Stages

> Owner: **D0xedDev / Cody** (@d0xb00m) · Co-pilot: Hermes (Devio)
> Repo: `BasedNUKEM/NEURAL_MESH` (branch `master`) · Live: `https://api.d0xeddev.com`
> Last updated: 2026-08-14 · Current shipped: **v0.29.0**

This is the **single source of truth for "what's next"**. It is goal-oriented on
purpose: every stage starts from the *outcome* we want to prove, then lists the
deliverables, acceptance criteria, and verification that make that outcome real.
When a stage ships, check its box in the README roadmap and update the
**Baseline** below.

---

## North Star

NEURAL_MESH is the **local-first typed-graph agentic-memory engine** that wins on
the things flat vector stores structurally cannot: no-stale-truth versioning,
cross-agent corroboration, associative (link-driven) recall, and honest,
reproducible benchmarks. Every stage below either (a) proves a capability with
real numbers, or (b) hardens the mesh so it can be trusted in shared, hostile
memory contexts.

---

## Baseline (where we actually are — 2026-08-14)

🟦 **Shipped:** v0.27.0 (memory-poisoning defense, OWASP ASI06), v0.26.0
(echo-chamber guard), v0.25.x (brain visual health), v0.21.0 (Rust resonance,
abi3), v0.20.0 (unified lifecycle), v0.18.0 (cross-agent `.mesh` + package).

🟦 **Live prod:** 580 nodes · `resonance_backend=rust` · Helixa signer
`degraded:false` (address `0x789B…`) · all public endpoints 200.

🟦 **Honest numbers on record:**
- Versioning / no-stale-truth: **100% current top-1 vs 16.7% flat** (zero stale leakage).
- Dense recall surfaces answer context ~59% more often than lexical (0.176 vs 0.110 ctxR@5).
- Resonance is ~5× *worse* than dense on direct QA (0.037 vs 0.176) — expected, it's for associative recall, not fact lookup.
- LongMemEval (hashed, dense, top_k=5): ctxR@1=0.070, ctxR@5=0.066, MRR=0.112 — **artifact numbers** (lexical substring on a bag-of-words embedder).

🟦 **Known gaps this doc closes:**
1. The README's own thesis — *"dense vectors should pull ahead with an LLM judge"* — is still **unproven** (roadmap checkbox unchecked).
2. Subgraph completeness under context budgets is "next on the roadmap" but has no published numbers.
3. The Rust accelerator covers query scoring + spread only; **BM25 / full-text** is the identified next hot path.
4. **LLM funding gate (verified 2026-08-14):** the OpenRouter account has exhausted its grant — `total_usage $10.20` > `total_credits $10.00` (`GET /v1/credits`). Every real answer/judge call 402s (`Payment Required`) even though the key is valid and both `deepseek/deepseek-chat` + `deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324` slugs return 200 on a trivial probe. Goals 1 + 5 (and the VPS `muse=llm`) are **blocked on a ~$10 top-up**, not on code.
5. The **live** `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is in `/opt/data/.env.d0xeddev_populated` (73 chars, `sk-or-v1-…`). The copies in `D0XEDDEV/.env` + `plugins/D0xeddev/.env` are **stale/truncated** (9–10 chars) and will 401. VPS mirror: `/root/.hermes/docker-data/.env`.

---

## Goal 1 — Prove dense retrieval wins end-to-end (LLM-judged LoCoMo QA)

**Outcome:** publish a defensible, reproduced number showing dense retrieval
beats lexical *when retrieved context is fed to a generative judge* — the exact
claim the README has promised since v0.14.0.

**Why this is the #1 next stage:** it is the only unchecked non-GO-gated roadmap
item, it closes the single biggest "honest-but-unproven" gap, and the entire
stack is already wired (`neural_mesh/eval.py → QAJudge + run_qa_eval`,
`neural_mesh/reader_llm.py → LLMReader`, `bench/locomo_llm_judge.py`). The only
missing piece is *actually running it and publishing numbers*.

### Deliverables
🟦 Step 0 — top up the OpenRouter account (usage already exceeds the $10 grant),
refresh the live key from `.env.d0xeddev_populated`, and pin a **currently-working**
model slug (verify with `scripts/llm_probe.py` before the run — `deepseek/deepseek-chat`
and `deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324` are both valid, but the account is out of credit).
🟦 Run the E2E harness over a real LoCoMo subset (start 100 queries, scale to full 1542).
🟦 Produce a comparison table: dense vs lexical vs hybrid vs resonance, scored by LLM judge.
🟦 Report EM/F1 with the LLM judge AND the extractive baseline so the improvement is visible.
🟦 Commit any fixes surfaced by the run (API drift, empty-content guards).

### Acceptance criteria
🟦 At least 100 queries judged end-to-end with a **generative** judge (not the keyword fallback).
🟦 Published table in README with reproduction command + cost note.
🟦 Honest framing preserved: report ties/wins for dense *and* a dense-wins-or-loses control; never spin a metric-mismatch.

### Verification
```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python3 bench/locomo_llm_judge.py --locomo locomo10.json --limit 100
# then a full run:
PYTHONPATH=. python3 bench/locomo_llm_judge.py --locomo locomo10.json
```

---

## Goal 2 — Subgraph completeness under context budgets

**Status: 🟦 DONE (v0.28.0, 2026-08-18)** — real numbers published below.

**Outcome:** a `topology_score` (or equivalent) that measures, under a bounded
context budget, what fraction of the *linked* memory neighborhood a retrieval
slice can carry — proving the mesh's structural recall survives compression.

**Published numbers (synthetic, 800 nodes × 5 edges, 100 seeds, `bench/subgraph_completeness.py`):**

| budget | subgraph_recall | edge_density | topology_score |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|----------------|
| k=5    | 0.0091          | 0.9990       | 0.0180         |
| k=10   | 0.0204          | 0.9973       | 0.0400         |
| k=20   | 0.0432          | 0.9970       | 0.0826         |
| k=50   | 0.1113          | 0.9346       | 0.1981         |

Honest note: synthetic graphs have uniform link probability; real mesh graphs
show higher variation due to semantic linking.

### Deliverables
- [x] Run the bench against the real mesh and a synthetic baseline.
- [x] Publish `topology_score` numbers at 2–3 context budgets (small / medium / large).
- [x] Document the reproduction command in README.

### Acceptance criteria
- [x] Numbers are real and reproducible from a clean checkout.
- [x] README gains a "subgraph completeness" section with the exact command + table.

## Goal 3 — Rust hot-path coverage: BM25 / full-text search

**Status: 🟦 DONE (v0.28.0, 2026-08-18)** — Rust BM25 shipped with parity + numbers.

**Outcome:** move lexical (bag-of-words) retrieval into the Rust accelerator, so
the *other* half of hybrid recall stops paying Python-level costs on large meshes.

**Published numbers (5000 docs, 50 queries, `bench/bm25_bench.py`):**
- WARM (persistent index — the realistic mesh path): **21.4×** (0.670s → 0.031s)
- ONE-SHOT (naive list-passing): 0.9× — honest note, the PyO3 corpus-conversion
  tax dominates; this is why the persistent `rust_mesh.Bm25Index` is the real path.
- Parity: max|py−rust| = 0.00, rank mismatches 0/50.

### Deliverables
- [x] `bm25_score` / `bulk_bm25` in `rust_mesh/` (pure Rust, abi3, no deps).
- [x] Wire into `neural_mesh/resonance.py` (or a lexical backend selector) with exact-parity tests.
- [x] Bench 5K/50K nodes; report the speedup honestly.

### Acceptance criteria
- [x] Parity tests: Rust BM25 produces identical ranked hits to Python lexical.
- [x] `.so` remains abi3-portable (`ldd rust_mesh.so | grep libpython` prints nothing).
- [x] `/health` or `rust-info` reports the new coverage.

---

## Goal 4 — Live Helixa on-chain attestation ✅ DONE (2026-08-18)

**Outcome:** signed + broadcast the standalone NEURAL_MESH identity on Base Mainnet.

### Broadcast (verified on-chain)
🟦 Tx: `0xb95f97e8ebb1d17a5039b4f8865a993a3384e953c7475343ca021f0d510d6e56`
🟦 New agentId (token): **63912**
🟦 Owner: `0x23129c…Ecd9` (verified via `ownerOf(63912)`)
🟦 Gas: 160668 (~0.000001 ETH at 0.006 gwei)
🟦 Block: 50147526 · status 1 (success)
🟦 BaseScan: https://basescan.org/tx/b95f97e8ebb1d17a5039b4f8865a993a3384e953c7475343ca021f0d510d6e56

### Fixes that made this possible
🟦 ERC-8004 ABI corrected (minimal registry: `register(string)` + `Registered(uint256 indexed,string,address indexed)`; no `totalSupply`/`tokenURI`/`Transfer`).
🟦 agentId decoded from `Registered` topic[1] (not `Transfer` topic[3]).
🟦 Real `broadcast_fn` wired into `attest_mesh_node(broadcast=True)`.
🟦 `/helixa/attest-node` accepts `broadcast` flag.
🟦 Manifest `registrations` now lists BOTH identities (Helixa 5287/60155 + NEURAL_MESH 63912).

### Note
The *Helixa agent* identity (agentId 59322 / helixa 60155) was already on-chain
from 2026-07-18. This new mint (63912) is a *standalone NEURAL_MESH* identity
NFT, distinct from the agent — both now on-chain and wired into the manifest.

### Acceptance criteria
🟦 On-chain tx hash recorded + verified (`ownerOf(63912)` = funded wallet; status 1).

## Goal 5 — LongMemEval: real embedder + judge (honest re-score)

**Status: 🟦 REAL-EMBEDDER + JUDGE DONE (2026-08-18)** — dense re-score (real
bge-small) AND two LLM-judge runs complete. See honest coverage caveat below.

**LLM judge run #1 (2026-08-18, deepseek-v4-flash, 100 cases, wall 10779.7s):**
- Judge F1 0.1686 over 39/100 answered (61 empty) — partial.

**LLM judge run #2 (2026-08-18, deepseek-v4-flash + 3× retry-on-empty, wall 6450.7s):**
- **Answered-only F1: 0.1541** (52/100 answered — retry recovered 13 cases)
- **Full-100 F1 (empties = 0): 0.0801** ← the honest, defensible number
- Per-category: temporal-reasoning 32/60 (F1 0.230); multi-session 20/40 (F1 0.033)
- **HONEST COVERAGE CAVEAT:** still 48/100 empty. Root cause = `deepseek-v4-flash`
  intermittently returns empty content (no error, HTTP 200) even with 3 retries.
  The harness aggregates judge F1 over **answer-present cases only**, so the
  0.1541 headline is NOT over all 100 — the full-100 number (empties=0) is 0.0801.
- **Fix applied:** harness default judge model bumped to
  `deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro-0813` (more reliable structured output). A re-run
  with that model should collapse the 48 empties and yield a full-coverage F1.

**Outcome:** replace the artifact numbers (bag-of-words substring check) with a
real `bge-small` embedder + `--judge` run so the LongMemEval row in the README
stops misleading.

**Why:** the current 0.070/0.066/0.112 numbers are *explicitly documented* as
lexical artifacts, not quality. Re-running with real embeds + a judge converts a
known-weak number into a defensible one (or an honest "we're not competitive yet").

**Real-embedder re-score (2026-08-18, bge-small-en-v1.5 via fastembed, dense,
top_k=5, 100 cases, wall 2612.9s):**

| Metric | hashed baseline (100) | **real bge-small (100)** |
|--------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| contextRecall@1 | 0.070 | **0.090** |
| contextRecall@5 | 0.066 | **0.112** |
| MRR | 0.112 | **0.161** |

Per-category (first-100 slice: 60 temporal-reasoning + 40 multi-session):
temporal ctxR@1=0.083 / ctxR@5=0.113 / MRR=0.135; multi-session
ctxR@1=0.100 / ctxR@5=0.110 / MRR=0.200.

Honest read: even on the *lexical substring check* (which historically favors the
hashed bag-of-words embedder), real bge-small surfaces more gold-answer context —
the semantic embeddings help retrieval, they don't hurt it. Still a lexical
artifact metric; a real LLM judge is the quality read (pending).

**Harness bug fixed (this milestone):** `--embedder real` constructed
`RealEmbedder()` in `main()` but never passed it to `run_benchmark`, which fell
into `Mesh(..., embedder=None)` (breaks — known pitfall). The real embedder was
never actually used before. Fixed: pass the instance through; `run_benchmark`
defaults to hashed when None.

### Acceptance criteria
🟦 Real-embedder numbers published alongside the hashed baseline.
🟦 README states plainly which is which.
🟦 Numbers come from an actual bge-small run (verified embedder= in output).
🟦 Judge run (Hermes/Nous LLM path) for semantic EM/F1 — DONE (two runs; final
honest number = full-100 F1 0.0801, answered-only 0.1541 over 52/100; default
model fixed to v4-pro-0813 for a full-coverage re-run).

---

## Goal 6 — v0.29.0: fused retrieval, x402 selector fix, reputation-sync repair (2026-08-24)

**Status:** 🟦 SHIPPED CODE + TESTS GREEN (release commit pending fused-bench verdict)

🟦 **Query-rewrite verdict banked (honest):** dense+rewrite MRR 0.2758 vs dense
baseline 0.277 on the stratified-100 real-embedder run → **tie/noise**.
`query_rewrite` stays opt-in (`Mesh(query_rewrite=True)`), default OFF.

🟦 **Resonance wins end-to-end with a generative judge** (stratified 100,
real bge-small, v4-flash judge): judge F1 **0.344 / EM 0.250** vs dense
F1 0.326 / EM 0.200. Raw MRR ties (0.276 both) — spreading activation surfaces
answer-bearing context that flat ranking misses. The old "resonance is 5×
worse" LoCoMo finding is a metric mismatch; judged QA is the quality read.

🟦 **`Mesh.fused_recall(query, top_k, alpha=0.5)`** — reciprocal-rank fusion of
dense + resonance candidate lists. Wired into the LongMemEval harness and
`bench/retrieval_experiment.py` as mode `fused`. Directional hashed-embedder
run is uninformative (all modes identical under bag-of-words — known artifact);
decision-grade verdict requires the real embedder.

🟦 **SECURITY FIX — x402 receipt selector was WRONG:** `x402_recall.py` used
NIST SHA3-256 (hashlib.sha3_256 → `0x378c745b`), but Ethereum uses Keccak-256;
the true selector for `recordReceipt(string,address,address,uint256,bytes32)`
is **`0x23d1ad26`**. Every legitimate receipt would have failed verification.
Fixed with `_keccak256()` (pycryptodome when present + pure-Python
Keccak-f[1600] fallback — core stays pip-free). Both paths tested equal.
Test suite updated to import the module's real selector.

🟦 **erc8004_reputation_sync.py repaired (2 dead-on-arrival bugs):**
(1) `mesh.stats()['total_nodes']` KeyError → stats returns `{total,hot,cold}`;
(2) `Mesh(":memory:")` always saw an empty mesh ("no nodes" every run) →
defaults to the repo `mesh.db`. Dry-run now works: live signal value **87/100**,
mean trust 0.869 over 252 nodes, zero quarantined. `--execute` remains gated:
web3 not installed AND the Base ReputationRegistry address is still TBD
(spec doc: "Awaiting deploy") — deploy decision is a human GO.

### Verification
```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python3 -m unittest discover -s tests   # core
.venv-server/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests  # full incl. server (222 OK)
PYTHONPATH=. .venv-server/bin/python bench/retrieval_experiment.py \

```

## Goal 7 — v0.30.0: Federated x402 Memory Economy 🟦 IN PROGRESS (2026-08-31)

**Status:** 🟦 BUILDING — this is the "next layer" that turns NEURAL_MESH from a
single brain into a *network* of agents that can't fake their memory.

**Outcome:** prove and ship the full cross-agent memory-economy loop end to end:
agents **discover** each other, **reputation-gate** who they'll trust, **pay** per
recall via x402 receipts (Base), **recall** each other's memory, and
**corroborate** matching facts so trust compounds (`1-(1-t_a)(1-t_b)`). The mesh
becomes the substrate for "agents that can't fake their settle" — every pulse a
receipt, every reflex settled USDC. This is the story Cody is already telling on
X; this milestone makes it real, testable, and shipped.

**Why this layer:** the pieces already exist but are **inert**:
- `x402_recall.py` `PaidRecallGate` — built, tested, but no consumers.
- `peer.py` `PeerClient` — federation client, single-agent only.
- `reputation.py` — ERC-8004 signals, off-chain only.
- `sharing.py` `merge_peer_mesh` / `consensus_rank` — file-based, not networked.

None of them compose. This goal composes them into one orchestrator +
server endpoint + demo + tests, so a remote agent can *pay to query* the mesh
and the result is trust-weighted, provenance-stamped, corroboration-bumped.

### Deliverables
🟦 `neural_mesh/federation.py` — `FederatedRecall` orchestrator:
  1. **Discover** peers via `PeerClient.discover()` (manifest + capabilities).
  2. **Reputation-gate**: query each peer's ERC-8004 reputation signal; cap
     trust by reputation (low-rep peer → `cap_trust` floor). Refuse to pay
     peers below a `min_rep` threshold.
  3. **Pay + recall**: for each trusted peer, issue `paid_recall` with an x402
     proof (real on-chain verify, or a test/mock proof in dry-run mode).
  4. **Merge + corroborate**: collect ranked hits, dedupe by content hash,
     fuse matching facts via corroboration math, run `consensus_rank` so the
     highest-trust claim wins per conflict_group.
  5. **Report**: per-peer payment, provenance, trust caps, corroboration bumps,
     final consensus-ranked list with proof cards.
🟦 `demos/federation_economy.py` — 3 in-memory meshes (Agent A buyer + Peer B/C
sellers with overlapping + contradicting facts), full loop, real printed numbers
(trust before/after corroboration, per-peer payment, consensus winner). Zero
external deps (mock proof path). This is the "give them something to remember"
showcase.
🟦 `tests/test_federation.py` — RED→GREEN: gate refuses low-rep/unknown peer,
cap_trust honored, corroboration lift, consensus winner over contradiction,
replay-safe, merge keeps provenance.
🟦 `POST /mesh/federated/recall` server endpoint (AUTH) — query this mesh as a
paid federated peer, x402-gated, returning the full merged consensus report.
🟦 Manifest `capabilities` gains `"federated_recall"`.

### Acceptance criteria
🟦 Demo runs end-to-end with real numbers, no external deps.
🟦 New tests GREEN; full regression (222+ OK) still passes.
🟦 Live endpoint returns a valid federation report on the real mesh.
🟦 Version bumped v0.30.0 in all 4 locations; clean package install; deployed;
`/health` + endpoints verified.
🟦 X announcement posts (this milestone AND the missed v0.29).

### Verification
```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python3 demos/federation_economy.py
PYTHONPATH=. python3 -m unittest tests.test_federation -v

## Goal 8 — v0.31.0: Federated DREAM — the Self-Healing Memory Commons 🟦 IN PROGRESS (2026-08-31)

**Status:** 🟦 BUILDING — the supply side of the memory economy. v0.30 built
*demand* (pay to buy a peer's memory); v0.31 builds *supply + self-healing*:
agents contribute their consolidated DREAM insight to a **shared memory
commons**, and every contribution must pass the reputation gate, the
ContentValidator poison scan, and corroboration before it lands. Honest,
corroborated wisdom spreads and compounds; garbage and poison get quarantined
or refused. This is "natural selection onchain" made complete.

**Outcome:** an agent runs its DREAM cycle → mints insight nodes → publishes
them to a federated commons → peers receive, gate, scan, and corroborate each
contribution → only insight that clears the gate lands (writeback) with its
provenance + trust intact. A malicious or low-reputation contribution is
quarantined / refused and never reaches the live mesh.

**Why this layer:** v0.30 gave agents a way to *pay* for each other's memory but
nothing to *give back*. Without a gated supply path, the commons can't grow
honestly. This layer closes the loop so the mesh's DREAM cycle (already shipped
since v0.8) becomes federated and self-selecting.

### Deliverables
🟦 `neural_mesh/federated_dream.py` — `FederatedDream` orchestrator:
  1. **Contribute** — package a mesh's DREAM insight nodes (or a caller-supplied
     insight list) into a portable contribution set (content, provenance, by,
     agent_id, trust, source mesh URL).
  2. **Gate (receive)** — for each contributed insight: reputation-gate
     (refuse low-rep / unknown contributor), ContentValidator scan (malicious →
     quarantine lane), corroboration against the local mesh (matches an existing
     live node → corroboration trust bump).
  3. **Writeback** — accepted insights land in the local mesh with
     `provenance="federated-dream"`, `by=<contributor>`, source mesh stamped in
     `meta`. Quarantined insight lands in `lane="quarantine"` (zero resonance,
     zero links, audit-only). Refused insight is dropped with a reason.
  4. **Report** — per-insight verdict: accepted / corroborated / quarantined /
     refused, with provenance + trust preserved for downstream consensus.
🟦 `demos/federated_dream_commons.py` — 3-mesh showcase: honest contributor's
insight corroborates → **accepted** (trust bumped); poison insight (injection
idiom) → **quarantined**; low-rep contributor's insight → **refused**. Zero
external deps, real printed numbers.
🟦 `tests/test_federated_dream.py` — RED→GREEN: honest insight accepted, poison
quarantined, low-rep refused, corroboration bump on writeback, provenance
stamped, malicious insight never reaches live mesh.
🟦 `POST /mesh/federated/dream` (AUTH) — receive a contribution set, run the
gate, return the verdict report. Manifest `capabilities` gains
`"federated_dream"`.

### Acceptance criteria
🟦 Demo runs end-to-end with real numbers, no external deps.
🟦 New tests GREEN; full regression (242+ OK) still passes.
🟦 Live endpoint returns a valid gate verdict on the real mesh.
🟦 Version bumped v0.31.0 in all spots; clean package install; deployed;
`/health` + endpoints verified.
🟦 X announcement posts.

### Verification

## Goal 9 — v0.32.0: MeshFederation — the Bidirectional Economy Loop 🟦 IN PROGRESS (2026-08-31)

**Status:** 🟦 BUILDING — composes v0.30 (demand/pull) + v0.31 (supply/push) into
ONE reconciliation loop, run against a real list of peer meshes, with
**corroboration-lift as the economic primitive**.

**Outcome:** a `MeshFederation` orchestrator that, in a single `reconcile()` pass,
both **pulls** memory from peers (discover → rep-gate → x402 pay → recall →
corroborate) and **pushes** its own DREAM insight back (contribute → gate →
scan → corroborate → writeback). It accounts the network's earned trust as a
ledger: per-corroboration trust lift (old → new), poisoned insight refused, and
low-rep contributions refused. This closes the loop completely — every node
pays for what it takes and contributes what it knows, and corroboration is the
currency that compounds.

**On-chain receipts:** the x402 payment path already supports `dry_run=False`
(real on-chain verification via `verify_receipt_onchain`). Broadcasting a real
receipt tx stays **GO-gated** (gas + irreversible). This layer integrates and
reconciles that path but does NOT broadcast.

**Why this layer:** v0.30 and v0.31 shipped the two halves but nothing runs them
together. Without a reconcile loop, a mesh either buys or contributes — never
both. This is the layer that makes a *network* behave like one living economy.

### Deliverables
🟦 `neural_mesh/network.py` — `MeshFederation` orchestrator:
  1. **Register** a local mesh + N peers (PeerClient or in-memory fakes) + a
     query plan (one or more queries to reconcile on).
  2. **`reconcile()`** — one pass:
     - **Pull**: for each query, run `FederatedRecall` (rep-gate → pay → recall →
       corroborate). Fold the local mesh in; collect the corroboration lifts.
     - **Push**: package the local mesh's live nodes (optionally post-DREAM) as
       contributions, run `FederatedDream` gate on each peer's mesh, collect
       verdicts (accepted / corroborated / quarantined / refused).
     - **Ledger**: aggregate total corroboration lift, poisoned refused, low-rep
       refused, nodes written, payments made.
  3. **`report()`** — the full network ledger with per-peer + per-query detail.
🟦 `demos/network_economy.py` — 4-mesh bidirectional loop (hub A pulls from B/C,
pushes to B/C; D injects poison). Real numbers: pull corroboration lifts, push
accepted/quarantined/refused, total network trust earned. Zero external deps.
🟦 `tests/test_network.py` — RED→GREEN: reconcile pull corroborates, push gates,
poison quarantined on push, low-rep refused on both, ledger totals correct,
provenance preserved.
🟦 `POST /mesh/federation/sync` (AUTH) — run `reconcile()` against configured
peers, return the ledger. Manifest `capabilities` gains `"mesh_federation"`.

### Acceptance criteria
🟦 Demo runs end-to-end with real numbers, no external deps.
🟦 New tests GREEN; full regression (248+ OK) still passes.
🟦 Live endpoint returns a valid ledger on the real mesh.
🟦 Version bumped v0.32.0 in all spots; clean package install; deployed;
`/health` + endpoints verified.
🟦 X announcement posts.

## Goal 10 — v0.34.0: Proof-of-Memory (PoM) — memory you'd bet on 🟦 DONE (2026-09-01)

**Status:** 🟦 DONE — turns the mesh's trust scalar into **collateral**. An agent
stakes USDC behind a memory claim (a bond); independent corroboration earns it
yield from an x402-funded truth pool; falsification **slashes the stake to the
challenger**. Settlement is the mesh's *own* truth machinery (supersede /
consensus / quarantine / staleness) — no central oracle, no new judge.

**Why this layer:** v0.32 made corroboration "the currency" as a metaphor — a
floating trust number with no economic skin in the game. PoM economizes it:
Filecoin proves *storage*; PoM proves *memory truth*. A decentralized trust
primitive with no central reputation authority, on Base (USDC + x402 + ERC-8004
already wired).

### Deliverables
🟦 `neural_mesh/bonds.py` — `BondLedger` (`stake_claim` / `corroborate_claim` /
`challenge_claim` / `settle_claim` / `release_claim`) + `settlement_verdict()` —
a deterministic, replayable pure function of mesh state. Pure stdlib, dry-run
micro-USDC.
🟦 `neural_mesh/bond_escrow.py` — on-chain USDC escrow/slash leg (Base):
`build_escrow_calldata()` emits real ABI calldata; dry-run default, real
broadcast GO-gated + fail-closed without a funded signer.
🟦 `bench/bond_economics.py` — honest ablation: cost-to-lie > 0 with a bond,
== 0 without. Emits `docs/assets/bond_economics.svg`. Pinned by tests.
🟦 `neural_mesh/federation.py` — `bond_trust_adjustment()` + `set_bond_ledger()`:
bonded value raises a peer's trust cap, slash history lowers it (floored).
🟦 `neural_mesh/reputation.py` — `mesh_signal(bond_stats=...)` exports
`bonded_value_usdc` + `slash_risk`. Manifest `capabilities` gains `proof_of_memory`.
🟦 `demos/bond_economy.py` — 4-agent showcase, zero deps.

### Acceptance criteria
🟦 Demo runs end-to-end with real numbers, no external deps.
🟦 33 new tests GREEN; full regression **278 OK**.
🟦 Settlement deterministic + replayable — pinned.
🟦 Onchain leg dry-run default, real broadcast GO-gated (documented gap).
🟦 Version bumped v0.34.0 in all spots; clean install `neural-mesh==0.34.0`;
deployed; `/health` verified.
🟦 X announcement posted + verified.

## Goal 11 — v0.35.0: "Temporal Mesh" — bi-temporal recall + reality reconciliation 🟦 (this upgrade)

**Status:** building (~289 tests GREEN so far; two structural gaps closed).

**Thesis:** every flat vector store answers only "what do we believe NOW"; it
cannot answer "what did we believe on Sep 3?" because the superseded state is
gone. NEURAL_MESH already *keeps* superseded nodes (versioning) — this upgrade
adds the missing *time axis* as a first-class query, plus the *reality half*
the Sibyl winners proved load-bearing. Two pure-stdlib, deterministic,
pip-free modules close the two structural gaps the field is converging on
(Zep/Graphiti bi-temporality, Rayyer's chain reconciliation).

### Theme A — bi-temporal recall (`neural_mesh/temporal.py`)
🟦 `MemoryNode` gains `valid_from` / `valid_to` (bi-temporal validity window);
`valid_from` defaults to `created_at`, `valid_to == 0` = open interval.
🟦 `_supersede` now **stamps `valid_to`** on the superseded fact, so "when did
this fact stop being true" becomes queryable, not just "it was replaced".
🟦 `valid_at(node, t)` — is the fact true at time t?
🟦 `snapshot(mesh, as_of)` — all live nodes true at as_of.
🟦 `recall_asof(mesh, q, as_of)` — dense recall within the snapshot.
🟦 `history(mesh, node_id)` — the version timeline (audit trail of a belief).
🟦 `resolve_at(mesh, node_id, t)` — which version was current at t.
🟦 `Mesh.snapshot()` / `Mesh.recall_asof()` methods + `/mesh/snapshot` and
`/mesh/recall_asof` HTTP routes.

### Theme B — reality reconciliation (`neural_mesh/reconcile.py`)
🟦 `ReconcileGate` verdicts a mesh claim against on-chain reality: `match` /
`mismatch` / `unverifiable`. Any `mismatch` = **VETO** (memory won't drive an
action it contradicts). Fail-open vs fail-closed on unverifiable.
🟦 Read-only, stdlib JSON-RPC against Base mainnet (`eth_balance`, `tx_status`,
`contract_code`, `erc20_balance`, `erc20_supply`, `block_height`); injectable
`fetcher` for hermetic tests. No signing, no broadcast.
🟦 `Mesh.reconcile(claims)` method + `/mesh/reconcile` HTTP route.

### Theme C — mesh diet (prod housekeeping)
🟦 Supersede-prune the accumulated `dream-muse` echo-chamber bloat (74.6% of
prod nodes at last read).

### Acceptance criteria
🟦 14+ new tests GREEN across lib + server routes; full regression passes.
🟦 Bi-temporal property pinned: `recall_asof` before a supersede returns the
old truth, after returns the new — both recoverable from one store.
🟦 Reconcile property pinned: MATCH allows, MISMATCH vetoes, UNVERIFIABLE obeys
fail-open/closed policy.
🟦 Version bumped v0.35.0 in all spots; deployed; `/health` verified.
🟦 Prod dream-muse bloat reduced; before/after node counts recorded.
🟦 X announcement posted + verified.

## Cross-cutting contracts (apply to EVERY stage)

### Honest benchmark contract (non-negotiable)
🟦 Report ties as ties, include dense-wins *and* dense-loses controls, state the metric's limitation.
🟦 Resonance's weak direct-QA number is a **metric mismatch**, never a "regression".
🟦 Never report a number you didn't generate.

### Release completion gate (order matters)
1. Final security patches → rerun RED/GREEN tests → focused suites → known-baseline full regression.
2. Clean isolated package install (`uv pip install --no-deps .` from a fresh venv).
3. Benchmark → live authenticated smoke → diff/secret review.
4. Commit as **Devio** → tag `vX.Y.Z` → `git push origin master --tags`.
5. Kill stale process (3-tier pattern) → clear bytecode → restart → verify `/health` version + endpoints.
6. **X announcement is a deliverable**, not a flourish — draft <280 chars, 🟦 bullets, full URL for the OG card, verify with `xurl read`.

### Version bump — FOUR locations (real pitfall)
`neural_mesh/__init__.py` + **three** hardcoded strings in `server.py` (health,
stats, ERC-8004 manifest). After bumping, `grep -rn '"0\.' neural_mesh/__init__.py server.py`
must show exactly 4 matches, all the new version.

### Git conventions
🟦 Repo is `BasedNUKEM` (never the `D0xedDev` org).
🟦 Commit author `Devio <basednukem@users.noreply.github.com>`.
🟦 Tag + push every shipped milestone.

## Priority order & dependencies

| # | Goal | Blocked by | Irreversible? | Status |
|---|------|-----------|---------------|--------|
| 1 | E2E LLM-judged LoCoMo QA | none (Nous portal path) | no | 🟦 DONE (v0.27.x, Nous model path) |
| 2 | Subgraph completeness | none | no | 🟦 DONE (v0.28.0) |
| 3 | Rust BM25 | none | no | 🟦 DONE (v0.28.0) |
| 4 | Helixa on-chain attestation | **human GO** | **yes** | 🟦 DONE (agentId 63912) |
| 5 | LongMemEval re-score | `fastembed` + key | no | next |

**Recommended execution order:** 1 → 2 → 3 (all non-irreversible, bundle in
parallel), then 5, then pause for GO on 4. Verify every irreversibility
on-chain before broadcasting.

## Risk register

🟦 **Model-slug drift:** OpenRouter deprecates free slugs and some hosted slugs
return empty content. Always `scripts/llm_probe.py` before a judge run.
🟦 **Funding / 402 gate:** the OpenRouter account is over its grant (`usage $10.20 >
credits $10.00`). Real answer/judge calls return 402 even with a valid key + slug.
Top up before any LLM-dependent goal; verify with `GET /v1/credits` first.
🟦 **Key rot:** local `D0XEDDEV/.env` + `plugins/D0xeddev/.env` carry truncated
9–10-char keys (401). The live key is `.env.d0xeddev_populated` (73 chars) or the
VPS parent env; never commit it.
🟦 **Restarts lie:** a stale PID serves old bytecode. Always `curl /health` for
the expected version after restart.
🟦 **Disk:** `/opt/data` can hit 100%; `df -h` before write-heavy ops, purge
`*.log.[2-9]` / `git gc` / `pip cache purge` if low.
